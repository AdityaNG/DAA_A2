# Assignment 2 Dijkstra's Algorithm

Implement Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to solve Single Destination Shortest Path problem. Single destination shortest path is finding shortest path from all the vertices to the given vertex.

## Input file

- Vertices are numbered 1 to n
- First line represents number of vertices
- This is followed by a set of lines
- Each line starts with a integer (any integer from 1 to n in any order) which represents vertex number (v_id) followed by space followed by a set of d pairs where d represents outdegree of the vertex v_id .First number in the pair represents neighbour vertex id and second number weight of the edge which connects vertex to the neighbour. Weight is always a non-negative integer

## Sample Input file
```
4
1 2 4 3 5 4 5
4 1 7 3 3
2 1 3 4 10
```

## Graph

```c
typedef struct vertex{
    int id;
    int weight;           
    struct vertex *next;
}Vertex;

typedef struct adjacencyList{
    Vertex *head;
}AdjacencyList;

/*
 * Initialises adjacency list with n nodes 
 * */
Graph_t* Graph_Init(int n);

/*
 * Appends a directional connection with a particular
 * DOES NOT HEAPIFY
 * */
void Graph_Append(Graph_t* g, int source, int destination, int weight);

/*
 * Frees all memory associated with the graph
 * Including the adj list
 * */
void Graph_Destroy(Graph_t* g);
```

## MinHeap

```c
typedef struct heapnode {
    int id;
    int distance;
    int predecessor; // Holds the id of the predecessor towards the destination
    // Used to print out the entire path from the node to the destination
} Heap_Node;

typedef struct minheap{
    int currentSize;
    int capacity;
    int *positionArray; // This array holds the position of the various vertices in the heap
    Heap_Node *heap;
} MinHeap_t;

/*
 * Initialises heap with n slots
 * Including the position array
 * */
MinHeap_t* Heap_Init(int n);

/*
 * Frees heap
 * Including the position array
 * */
void Heap_Destroy(MinHeap_t* h);

/*
 * Frees heap
 * Including the position array
 * */
void Heap_Insert(MinHeap_t* h, int id, int distance, int predecessor);

/*
 * Deletes 0th (smallest) element fromt heap
 * HEAPIFIES TOP DOWN
 * */
int Heap_Delete(MinHeap_t* h);

/*
 * Deletes 0th (smallest) element fromt heap
 * HEAPIFIES BOTTOM UP
 * */
void Heap_Update(MinHeap_t* h, int index, int newDistance, int newPredecessor);

/*
 * Returns the position of a particular id
 * */
int Heap_Search(MinHeap_t* h, int id);

/*
 * Returns the current size of the heap after deletions
 * */
int Heap_Size(MinHeap_t* h);

/*
 * Returns the distance of a particular id from the destination
 * */
int Heap_GetDistance(MinHeap_t* h, int index);
```

## Dijkstra

```c
/*
 * Prints all the shortest paths from all nodes to the destination
 * Each node has a 'predecessor' which points in the shortest direction to the destination
 *
 * If we start from a node and look at its predecessor and then look at its predecessor,
 * eventually we reach the destination.
 * 
 * We print out this path for all nodes (except the destination itself)
 * */
void printPath(MinHeap_t* h, int destination);

/*
 * Implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm
 * */
void Dijkstra(Graph_t g, int vertex);
```

# Testing

Implemented a testing script for the program that looks at all txt files within the specified `--input` folder and pair it with the file with the file with the same name in the `--output` folder and verify that the program is running appropriately

```bash
$ python3 tests/t1.py --input inputs/ --output outputs/
Testing  inputs/1.txt outputs/1.txt
Success
Testing  inputs/2.txt outputs/2.txt
Success
```
